This page needs to contain:

A list of all participating teams.
  * Display teams with vote buttons if in voting phase.

A partial to create a team if there are still spaces in the match 

Should this have two partials, one for players and one for viewers?


<% @teams.each do |team| %><br>
   <%= render :partial => '/teams/team_block_view', :team => team %>
<%end%>

<%= @votes %>
